# Problem 1

```{r problem1_setup, message = FALSE}
#read data in 
pols_month <- read_csv(file = "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv")
unemployment <- read_csv(file = "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv")
snp <- read_csv(file = "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv")

#check datasets
names(pols_month)
names(unemployment)
names(snp)
```
I've imported the three datasets in using relative paths. The files are in the fivethirtyeight_datasets folder within my subdirectory for this homework. I viewed the data (in console) and checked to see how the names were formatted
```{r problem1_manage_datasets}

```
