# Problem 1

``` r
#read data in 
pols_month <- read_csv(file = "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv")
unemployment <- read_csv(file = "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv")
snp <- read_csv(file = "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv")

#check datasets
names(pols_month)
```

    ## [1] "mon"      "prez_gop" "gov_gop"  "sen_gop"  "rep_gop"  "prez_dem" "gov_dem" 
    ## [8] "sen_dem"  "rep_dem"

``` r
names(unemployment)
```

    ##  [1] "Year" "Jan"  "Feb"  "Mar"  "Apr"  "May"  "Jun"  "Jul"  "Aug"  "Sep" 
    ## [11] "Oct"  "Nov"  "Dec"

``` r
names(snp)
```

    ## [1] "date"  "close"

Iâ€™ve imported the three datasets in using relative paths. The files are
in the fivethirtyeight_datasets folder within my subdirectory for this
homework. I viewed the data (in console) and checked to see how the
names were formatted
